### Everything you need to run this

```sh
# Install node dependencies
npm install

# Run the tests
npm test
```

To run the server by itself, simply type `npm start`, then you can `curl http://localhost:3000/` to hit an endpoint.

### Stuff we used
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/) as the server framework
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) as the test runner
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) as the test assertion library
